    "In this exercise we'll have a deeper look into the ability to use multiple RNN's to infer and generate sequences of data.\n",
    "Specifically we will implement a Encoder-Decoder RNN based for a simple sequence to sequence translation task.\n",
    "This type of models have shown impressive performance in Neural Machine Translation and Image Caption generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the encoder-decoder structure one RNN (blue) encodes the input into a hidden representation, and a second RNN (red) uses this representation to predict the target values.\n",
    "An essential step is deciding how the encoder and decoder should communicate.\n",
    "In the simplest approach you use the last hidden state of the encoder to initialize the decoder.\n",
